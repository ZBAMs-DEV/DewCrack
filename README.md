    🔐 DewCrack helps you understand how secure your passwords really are.

DewCrack is a password strength estimation tool that uses real-world logic based on password length, character variety, and cracking speed (hashrate) to show how long it might take an attacker to crack your password using brute-force methods.

Whether you're curious about how strong your current password is or want to learn how to improve your digital security, DewCrack gives you simple, actionable insights.

💡 Features:

    Estimate time to crack a password based on real hash speeds

    Understand the effect of password length and character sets

    Choose hash rates from dropdowns (e.g., 1 GH/s, 100 TH/s)

    Clear results with human-readable timeframes (seconds to centuries)

    Simple, readable interface with support for dark and light modes

    Educational Info Page explaining password best practices

    Learn how to use phrases, password managers, and unique passwords

🔒 Why it matters:

Your password might be more (or less) secure than you think. DewCrack helps demystify password strength using transparent, mathematical reasoning — not arbitrary "strength bars."
👥 Who it's for:

    Everyday users curious about password security

    Developers, ethical hackers, and IT students

    Anyone who wants to protect their digital life better

🧠 Learn:

    Why long passwords matter

    How character variety increases entropy

    What brute-force cracking really looks like

DewCrack doesn’t collect or store any data. All calculations happen on your device. Simply enter a test password (not your real one), explore cracking time estimates, and learn how to stay secure in today’s digital world.
